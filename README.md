# Let's create a safer Marshall Avenue

Marshall avenue between Victoria Street and Lexington Parkway desparately needs traffic calming and pedestrian safety measures implemented. This stretch of Marshall is a half mile long and contains 3 frequent pedestrian crossings at the Oxford, Chatsworth and Milton street intersections. As of the start of the 2025 school year, the city has just resurfaced Marshall avenue along this half mile stretch, but missed this perfect opportunity to add any useful traffic calming or pedestrian safety measures. This page exists as a place to showcase to the city the need for these measures and to provide links to our petition, survey and other resources for creating change in our community.

## Our Asks:

At a minimum, we are asking the city to paint crosswalks, and put up pedestrian walking signs at both ends of all three of the intersections: Oxford, Chatsworth, and Milton.

However, to achieve a much safer street for all users, we are asking the city to consider the following measures:

- Remove the suicide lane in the center of Marshall Ave. Suicide lanes are proven to be hazardous to drivers and pedestrians. There is no reason this stretch of road, with a 25 MPH speed limit needs a suicide lane installed for turning.
- In place of the suicide lane, the city should paint bike lanes onto both sides of the street

To go above and beyond and make the neighborhood not only a safe place for pedestrians, but an enjoyable place to walk or bike, we are asking the city to, in addition to the above suggestions, add bump outs at all four corners of each of the three intersections.
